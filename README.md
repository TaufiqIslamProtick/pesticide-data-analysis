## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. The project aims to predict future values based on patterns identified in historical data. Key components include data preprocessing, model parameter selection, evaluation, and visualization of the forecasted results.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Link to dataset source]
- **Description**: The dataset contains [X years/months/days] of data on [describe what the data represents, e.g., daily sales, stock prices, weather data].

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Converting the data to a stationary time series using differencing and transformations.
2. **ARIMA Modeling**: 
   - Identifying optimal parameters (`p`, `d`, `q`) using ACF/PACF plots.
   - Model fitting and fine-tuning.
3. **Evaluation**: 
   - Forecast accuracy measured using RMSE, MAE.
4. **Visualization**: 
   - Time series plot of actual vs forecasted values.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ARIMA-forecasting.git
   cd ARIMA-forecasting
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook arima_forecasting.ipynb
   ```
2. Run each cell to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Results
- The ARIMA model achieved an RMSE of **X** on the test dataset.
- Forecasted values show a **Y% improvement** compared to a baseline naive model.

## Report
### Introduction
This project explores the application of the ARIMA model for time series forecasting. The objective is to predict future values based on past observations in the dataset.

### Methodology Summary
- After performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and ensuring the time series is stationary, the ARIMA model was applied. Parameters were tuned using grid search, and the modelâ€™s performance was evaluated against test data.

### Results
The model effectively captured the trends and seasonality in the dataset, with an RMSE of **X**. Key insights included identifying seasonal patterns and long-term trends.

### Conclusion
The ARIMA model provides a robust approach to forecasting time series data with moderate complexity. Further tuning and exploration of more advanced models like SARIMA may enhance accuracy.
